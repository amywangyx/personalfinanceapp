## how to run it

Run following code other than anaconda installed: 
'''
pip install streamlit
'''
You might need to change the directory path to make sure the directory is correctly saved 
(subject to fix the problem) 

other improvements to make: 
align budgeting lines with spending on the same histograms 
algorithms to predict how much you spent this month( abnormal / normal) 
better visualization for categorizing changes and tagging
